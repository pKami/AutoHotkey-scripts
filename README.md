# AutoHotkey-scripts

A collection of my personal AutoHotkey scripts I've written throughout the years. Hope they can be useful to others too.

## Compatibility

Most of the scripts are adopted for usage with Windows, AutoHotkey Unicode v1.x, on a standard 16:9 or 16:10 monitor.

## Setup

* Install [Autohotkey](http://www.autohotkey.com/)
* git clone git@github.com:pKami/autohotkey-scripts.git

## Scripts

Many of my scripts use Ctrl+Shift+Z as the starting key combination. You're free to re-define that to whatever you need. It was just a habit of mine to have that key combo for scripts, since it doesn't collide or cover up anything I'd use frequently.

File | Function
-------- |  -----------
[Excel_BoldPartOfCellText.ahk](Excel_BoldPartOfCellText.ahk) | script for automating **bold**ing fragments of cells in Excel |
[KeyInfoTooltip.ahk](KeyInfoTooltip.ahk) | script that live displays information about pressed keys as a tooltip over the cursor |
[Filename.ahk](Filename.ahk) | Description |
TBD
